# JavaScript Null and Undefined Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to comparing null and undefined values using loose comparison.  The `foo` function is intended to handle null values gracefully, but fails to correctly manage undefined values, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution provides a more robust approach using strict equality (===).
